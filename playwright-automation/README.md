Guidelines and Best Practices:
1. Naming Conventions
    Page files, Steps files, Variables and Functions: Use camelCase for variables, functions, and method names.
     
2. Test Data Management (testdata.json)
    Centralize All Test Data: Store all the test data in a single testdata.json file, ensuring that all your dynamic values (e.g., credentials, user information, etc.) are managed in one place.

3. Test Configuration (cucumber.json)
    For local execution, it’s essential to configure different types of test runs (like smoke, regression, etc.) to handle various scenarios. You can create different configurations by using tags in Cucumber and configuring the cucumber.json accordingly.

4. Hooks: 
    Use Before/After hooks for setting up and tearing down your test environment.

5. CI and Reporting: 
    Integrate Playwright's reporter or Cucumber’s JSON output for test results, and ensure tests are run in the appropriate environment.

6. Define Scenarios Clearly:
    Each scenario should define a specific user flow or feature, but avoid writing excessive steps. If multiple scenarios share steps, extract the common functionality into reusable step definitions.

7. Use Background for Common Steps:
    If there are steps that are common to all scenarios in a feature file, consider using a Background section. This will reduce redundancy in each scenario and make your tests cleaner.

8. Dynamic Data:
    Instead of hardcoding values in the feature file, you use dynamic values ($username and $password) that are replaced during test execution based on the data in your JSON file.

9. Minimize Repetitive Steps:
    If your scenarios share similar steps (e.g., logging in, logging out, etc.), extract them into reusable steps in the step definitions. Each step should ideally cover a single user action. For example, "enter username and password" could be one step, while "click login" could be another.

10. Use of Tags:
    Use tags like @smoke, @regression, @happyPath, @negative, etc., to categorize your tests. You can run tests based on these tags.

11. Use Data Tables for Complex Data:
    For scenarios that require a table of data (e.g., for testing login with multiple sets of credentials), use Cucumber’s Data Tables.

12. Avoid Duplication of Steps:
    If the same steps appear in multiple scenarios, avoid repeating them in every scenario. Use Background or create reusable step definitions for actions that are common.
    For example, logging out can be a reusable step, and if it appears in multiple scenarios, write it as a reusable step definition.
